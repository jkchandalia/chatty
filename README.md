## Personal Content Curator

Let's curate all this content from research blogs and arxiv and make a personal content curator (pcc) for gen AI using gen AI :)

This simple web app uses streamlit. The system will pull new research/blog posts/articles daily from rss feeds or scraping and use a recommendation system to provide the most interesting items in a ranked list on the ui. The interface will allow a good/neutral/uninteresting button to label the resource which will in turn help retrain the recommender system. Links to the original source will be provided so I can keep up-to-date with research.

The chatbot interface may not be needed here. Or I could use the chat interface to trigger actions like feed pulls.
